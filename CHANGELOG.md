# Change Log

## v2.0.0

v2.0.0 contains configuration cleanup.

### Breaking Changes

- The message ID of the label for the panel `livingplant` has changed. It is now `panel.conservation.livingplant`. If you have customized this label using the previous message ID (`panel.collectionobject.livingplant`), update your configuration to use the new ID. The previous ID contained the incorrect record type name.
